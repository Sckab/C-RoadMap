# ðŸ“˜ Week 2 â€“ Pointers, Memory & Modular Code

> This week dives deep into what makes C unique: pointers and manual memory management. Youâ€™ll learn how memory works under the hood, practice with pointers, arrays, and functions, and start modularizing your code like a real dev.

---

## ðŸ“… Daily Breakdown

### ðŸ”¹ Day 8 â€“ Intro to Pointers
- Understand memory addresses (`&`) and dereferencing (`*`)
- Learn how to declare and use pointers
- Visualize pointer behavior with diagrams

**Mini Task:** Create a program that swaps two integers using pointers.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 9 â€“ Pointers & Arrays
- Learn how arrays and pointers relate
- Indexing with pointer arithmetic
- Use pointers to traverse arrays

**Mini Task:** Write a program that calculates the average of a float array using pointers.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 10 â€“ Strings in C
- Work with strings as char arrays
- Functions: `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`, `strcat`
- Null terminator and common string pitfalls

**Mini Task:** Implement your own `strlen` and `strcpy`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 11 â€“ Dynamic Memory Allocation
- `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`
- Understand heap vs stack
- Handle memory safely and check for leaks

**Mini Task:** Create a program that asks for `n` integers and stores them in a dynamically allocated array.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 12 â€“ Structs & Typedef
- Define and use `struct`s
- Group related data into one type
- Use `typedef` for cleaner syntax

**Mini Task:** Define a `Student` struct and store a list of students using dynamic memory.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 13 â€“ Modular Programming
- Split code into `.h` and `.c` files
- Learn how to use header guards
- Use `Makefile` for building multi-file projects

**Mini Task:** Refactor one of your previous programs into a multi-file structure with headers.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 14 â€“ Mini Project: Student Record System
- Write a terminal app to:
  - Add, remove, and display student info
  - Use structs, arrays, and dynamic memory
  - Separate code into `.h` and `.c` files
  - Compile with a `Makefile`

## ðŸ§  Weekly Goals
âœ… Understand pointers deeply  
âœ… Use dynamic memory and avoid leaks  
âœ… Build modular, clean code with header files  
âœ… Practice with arrays, strings, and structs  
âœ… Master writing and compiling multi-file programs

---

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips
- Always `free()` what you `malloc()`
- Use `valgrind` often to catch memory leaks
- Prefer `calloc` over `malloc` for zeroed memory
- Use `typedef struct` to simplify code readability

---

## ðŸš« Bad Habits to Avoid
- Forgetting to `free()` memory
- Accessing out-of-bounds array indices
- Dereferencing NULL pointers
- Mixing up `*` and `&` in function arguments

---

## âœ… Good Habits to Build
- Draw memory diagrams to debug pointers
- Comment pointer logic clearly
- Always check if `malloc` returns NULL
- Write modular code with reusable functions
