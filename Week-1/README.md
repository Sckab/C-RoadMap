# ðŸ“˜ Week 1 â€“ Intro to C & First Programs

> This week is all about getting your setup ready, understanding the basics of the C language, and writing your first simple programs. Youâ€™ll get comfortable with compiling, debugging, and writing code from scratch.

---

## ðŸ“… Daily Breakdown

### ðŸ”¹ Day 1 â€“ Setup + Hello World
- Install your toolchain: `gcc`, `clang`, `make`, `valgrind`, `gdb`
- Set up your Neovim with `clangd`, `coc.nvim`, or `nvim-lspconfig`
- Create your first `hello.c` and compile it
- Try out different `printf()` formats

**Mini Task:** Write a program that prints your name, age, and favorite programming language.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 2 â€“ Variables, Types, and I/O
- Learn about basic types: `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`
- Explore `scanf`, `getchar`, `putchar`, and `gets` (legacy)
- Type modifiers: `unsigned`, `short`, `long`, `long long`

**Mini Task:** Create a program that reads your full name and age, and prints a greeting.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 3 â€“ Conditionals
- Study `if`, `else`, and `switch`
- Learn about relational and logical operators
- Understand precedence and short-circuiting

**Mini Task:** Write a simple age-checker that tells if you're a minor, adult, or elder.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 4 â€“ Loops (for, while, do...while)
- Use loops to repeat actions
- Practice break and continue
- Write counting and reverse loops

**Mini Task:** Create a number guessing game using `rand()` and `while`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 5 â€“ Functions
- Write your own functions
- Learn about return types, parameters, void
- Understand scope and variable lifetimes

**Mini Task:** Implement a simple calculator using functions for each operation.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 6 â€“ Practice Day
- Review everything from the week
- Refactor code from previous tasks
- Explore `man` pages and `info` for C functions

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 7 â€“ Mini Project: CLI Calculator
- Write a calculator that takes two numbers and an operator
- Use `switch` or `if` for operation selection
- Add error handling (dividing by zero etc.)
- Modularize with header and source files
- Write a basic `Makefile` to build it

---

## ðŸ“š Recommended Resources

- ðŸ“˜ *The C Programming Language* by K&R (Chapters 1â€“3)
- ðŸ“— *Learn C the Hard Way* â€“ Exercises 1â€“7
- ðŸ“º [freeCodeCamp: C Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJgsSFOSQv0)

## ðŸ§  Weekly Goals
âœ… Get comfortable with basic syntax  
âœ… Understand variables, conditionals, loops, and functions  
âœ… Write your first reusable code  
âœ… Compile and run from terminal confidently  
âœ… Complete your first working CLI program!

---

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips
- Compile with flags: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c11`
- Use `valgrind` even for simple programs
- Write one function per task â†’ makes testing easier
- Comment your logic early â†’ get used to doc style

---

## ðŸš« Bad Habits to Avoid
- Skipping compiler warnings
- Using global variables unnecessarily
- Overcomplicating logic early on
- Not modularizing your code

---

## âœ… Good Habits to Build
- Writing clean and consistent formatting
- Naming variables with intent (`total_sum`, not `ts`)
- Testing edge cases even for small programs
- Using `git` to track daily progress
