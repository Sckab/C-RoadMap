# ðŸ“˜ Week 4 â€“ Data Structures, Linked Lists & Hash Tables

> This week is all about building powerful custom data structures from scratch. Youâ€™ll learn about linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables â€” all in pure C. No standard libraries. Just malloc, pointers, and big brain energy ðŸ§ âš¡

---

## ðŸ“… Daily Breakdown

### ðŸ”¹ Day 22 â€“ Intro to Data Structures
- Understand how memory layout relates to data structures
- Learn when and why to use custom structs
- Plan for future: linked lists, stacks, etc.

**Mini Task:** Create a simple `Book` struct and an array of books that you can loop through and print.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 23 â€“ Singly Linked Lists
- Define and build a singly linked list
- Add functions to insert, delete, traverse
- Use dynamic memory (`malloc`) for each node

**Mini Task:** Build a list of tasks and allow adding/removing them via a menu.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 24 â€“ Doubly Linked Lists
- Extend your list to have `prev` and `next` pointers
- Handle edge cases (empty list, head/tail insertions)
- Free all memory when the list is deleted

**Mini Task:** Build a history tracker that goes forward/back like a browser history.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 25 â€“ Stacks and Queues (with Lists)
- Use a linked list to implement a Stack (LIFO)
- Use a linked list to implement a Queue (FIFO)
- Practice real-world use cases

**Mini Task:** Create a reverse string app using a stack.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 26 â€“ Hash Tables (Basics)
- Understand hash functions and collisions
- Use arrays + linked lists to build buckets
- Store key-value pairs (string â†” int)

**Mini Task:** Create a word frequency counter using a custom hash table.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 27 â€“ Hash Tables (Advanced)
- Improve your hashing function
- Use `uthash.h` or implement your own with dynamic resizing
- Handle collisions better (chaining or open addressing)

**Mini Task:** Extend your word counter to read from a file and show the top 10 most common words.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 28 â€“ Mini Project: INI File Parser
- Build a parser for `.ini` config files:
  - Parse `[section]` and `key=value` pairs
  - Store them in a hash map or linked list
  - Allow querying values via CLI
  - Print full config to stdout
  - Handle syntax errors and whitespace

---

## ðŸ“š Recommended Resources

- ðŸ§¾ [uthash.h Library](https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/)
- ðŸ“˜ *C Programming: A Modern Approach* â€“ Chapter on Data Structures
- ðŸ“º [Linked Lists in C â€“ freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdQeNxWCguQ)

---

## ðŸ§  Weekly Goals
âœ… Understand and implement linked lists  
âœ… Build your own stack and queue from scratch  
âœ… Learn how hash tables work and use them  
âœ… Apply data structures in a real parser project  
âœ… Manage memory manually and handle pointers precisely

---

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips
- Always `free()` your entire list (recursively or iteratively)
- Print your structures with debug messages during development
- Use `gdb` to inspect `next`, `prev`, and memory layout
- Test edge cases: empty list, single node, null pointers

---

## ðŸš« Bad Habits to Avoid
- Losing track of `next` and `prev` pointers
- Not checking if malloc returns NULL
- Forgetting to free buckets in hash tables
- Using arrays when linked lists are more efficient

---

## âœ… Good Habits to Build
- Visualize your data structures on paper or draw.io
- Break logic into functions: `insert()`, `delete()`, `print()`
- Use typedefs to simplify list/struct definitions
- Write unit-test-like checks even for small components
