# ðŸ“˜ Week 3 â€“ Files, Command-Line Apps & Debugging

> This week is all about building real-world, command-line applications and learning to interact with files. Youâ€™ll also dive into debugging tools and improve your workflow to catch and fix bugs like a pro.

---

## ðŸ“… Daily Breakdown

### ðŸ”¹ Day 15 â€“ File I/O Basics
- Understand file streams: `FILE *`, `fopen`, `fclose`
- Use `fprintf`, `fscanf`, `fgets`, `fputs`, `fread`, `fwrite`
- Learn about text vs binary modes

**Mini Task:** Write a program that saves a to-do list to a text file and loads it on startup.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 16 â€“ File Operations & Error Handling
- Check if a file exists before opening
- Handle file-related errors
- Learn file modes: `"r"`, `"w"`, `"a"`, `"r+"`, etc.

**Mini Task:** Extend the to-do list app to allow deleting and appending tasks safely.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 17 â€“ Command-Line Arguments
- Use `main(int argc, char *argv[])`
- Parse flags like `-v`, `-h`, `--help`
- Learn basic CLI app design

**Mini Task:** Make a CLI version of your to-do app with arguments like `--add`, `--remove`, `--list`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 18 â€“ Debugging with GDB
- Learn the basics of GDB: breakpoints, `run`, `next`, `print`, `watch`
- Practice stepping through code
- Use `gdb -tui` for terminal interface

**Mini Task:** Debug a buggy version of a calculator app and log all your steps.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 19 â€“ Valgrind & Sanitizers
- Use `valgrind --leak-check=full` to detect memory leaks
- Add compile flags for ASan and UBSan
- Fix memory issues and understand error messages

**Mini Task:** Write a program with intentional memory issues, then fix them with valgrind + ASan.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 20 â€“ Logging & Error Codes
- Return custom error codes
- Use `stderr` for error messages
- Create log files to trace execution

**Mini Task:** Add logging and error codes to your CLI to-do app.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 21 â€“ Mini Project: CLI To-Do Manager
- Create a fully working command-line to-do manager:
  - Add/remove tasks with flags
  - Save/load from file
  - Log operations in a `.log` file
  - Handle invalid input and show help
  - Build with Makefile

## ðŸ§  Weekly Goals
âœ… Understand how to read and write files  
âœ… Build real CLI tools with argument parsing  
âœ… Learn GDB and Valgrind for debugging  
âœ… Handle errors and log properly  
âœ… Build apps that persist and manage data

---

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips
- Always `fclose()` your files
- Use `feof` and `ferror` to check stream state
- Keep command-line apps clean and modular
- Use `.log` files for debugging behavior in production

---

## ðŸš« Bad Habits to Avoid
- Ignoring error returns from `fopen`, `fscanf`, etc.
- Forgetting to close files
- Hardcoding file paths
- Not testing with edge cases (empty files, long input, etc.)

---

## âœ… Good Habits to Build
- Design CLI apps like a real user would use them
- Log errors to stderr, not stdout
- Treat every file operation as a potential fail
- Use `make run` or `make debug` in your Makefile to automate testing
