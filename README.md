# 🧠 Learn C in 60 Days – From Basics to Kernel Dev

> A 60-day journey to master the C language — from your first `hello world` all the way to building a mini kernel, passing through shells, IDEs, terminal UIs, file parsers, system programming, and kernel modules.

## 🧭 How to Use This Roadmap

### Daily:
- Go into the folder for the current day (`Week-XX/Day-YY`)
- Read the day’s task or notes
- Study, experiment, code, debug — and most importantly, **have fun**
- Track your progress using Git (frequent commits!)

### Weekly:
- Complete the **mini project** (e.g. calculator, shell, parser, kernel toy...)
- Review concepts and refactor any messy code
- Document your progress and lessons learned
