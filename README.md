# 🧠 Learn C in 60 Days – From Basics to Kernel Dev

> A 60-day journey to master the C language — from your first `hello world` all the way to building a mini kernel, passing through shells, IDEs, terminal emulators, file parsers, debuggers, kernel modules and much more.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

This repo is divided into **8 weekly folders**, each containing:
- 📂 `day-01`, `day-02`, ... → daily code, exercises, notes
- 📁 `mini-project/` → weekly project challenge
- 📄 `README.md` → weekly goals, sources, and tips

📦 Root structure:

## 🧭 How to Use This Roadmap

### Daily:
- Go into the folder for the current day (`week-XX/day-YY`)
- Read the day’s task or notes
- Study, experiment, code, debug — and most importantly, **have fun**
- Track your progress using Git (frequent commits!)

### Weekly:
- Complete the **mini project** (e.g. calculator, shell, parser, kernel toy...)
- Review concepts and refactor any messy code
- Document your progress and lessons learned

## 🛠 Requirements

- 🐧 **Arch Linux** (or any Unix-like distro)
- 🧠 Preferred editor: **Neovim** (custom config for max vibes)
- 🧰 Tools: `gcc`, `clang`, `make`, `valgrind`, `gdb`, `cmake`, `clang-format`, `cppcheck`
- 🔍 Debug: `gdb`, `valgrind`, `asan`, `ubsan`
- 📚 Optional libraries: `ncurses`, `uthash`, `cJSON`, `pthread`, `readline`
- 📦 Build tools: `make`, `CMake`
- 💻 Plugin game: `coc.nvim` or `nvim-lspconfig` with `clangd` recommended

## 📷 Screenshots (soon)

📸 Once projects are done, drop some cool screenshots here — terminal UIs, ncurses apps, your kernel booting up in QEMU... flex that code.
