# ðŸ“˜ Week 5 â€“ Terminal UI, Threads & CLI UX

> Time to make your apps interactive and real-time! This week you'll learn how to build fancy terminal UIs using `ncurses`, make your apps multitask with threads, and improve the overall UX of your CLI projects.

---

## ðŸ“… Daily Breakdown

### ðŸ”¹ Day 29 â€“ Terminal Output Control
- ANSI escape codes for colors and cursor movement
- Clear screen, move cursor, color text, invert styles
- Use `\033[` sequences like a pro

**Mini Task:** Create a banner generator that prints styled text with colors and effects.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 30 â€“ Intro to ncurses
- Install and set up `ncurses.h`
- Create windows, handle key input, and draw boxes
- Use `getch()`, `printw()`, `refresh()`

**Mini Task:** Build a mini dashboard with a real-time clock and menu.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 31 â€“ Menus & Key Input
- Build interactive menus with key navigation
- Highlight selection with reverse colors
- Handle `ESC`, `ENTER`, and arrow keys

**Mini Task:** Create a menu-based to-do list with add/delete using `ncurses`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 32 â€“ Threads in C (POSIX pthreads)
- Use `pthread_create`, `pthread_join`, `pthread_exit`
- Learn about race conditions and data sharing
- Use mutexes (`pthread_mutex_t`) to protect shared data

**Mini Task:** Create two threads that print messages in parallel with no overlap.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 33 â€“ Background Tasks & CLI Multitasking
- Build apps with async behaviors (e.g. autosave every X seconds)
- Mix user input + background logic
- Coordinate with mutexes or condition variables

**Mini Task:** Update your dashboard to autosave logs every 5s via a background thread.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 34 â€“ UI Polishing & CLI UX
- Add help screens, key hints, colors, and borders
- Animate transitions (clear/redraw)
- Improve CLI experience with spacing, feedback, and error handling

**Mini Task:** Make your CLI dashboard *pretty* and user-friendly with small animations.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 35 â€“ Mini Project: Terminal Dashboard App
- Real-time terminal UI with:
  - Dynamic menu
  - Background thread (e.g. timer, logger)
  - Async user input
  - Autosave to file
  - Help menu and fancy layout
  - `Makefile` and `README`

## ðŸ§  Weekly Goals
âœ… Build interactive apps in the terminal  
âœ… Learn how to use ncurses for menus and visuals  
âœ… Understand how to create and manage threads  
âœ… Improve CLI UX with colors, layouts and responsiveness  
âœ… Mix input, output, and background logic together

---

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips
- Always refresh `ncurses` windows after updates
- Use threads only where it makes sense (don't overkill)
- Protect shared variables with mutexes
- Provide user feedback for every key/action

---

## ðŸš« Bad Habits to Avoid
- Ignoring race conditions between threads
- Overusing `usleep()` for delays
- Not restoring terminal state after crash
- Not testing how the UI reacts in different terminal sizes

---

## âœ… Good Habits to Build
- Keep UI and logic code separate
- Build `help` and `usage` screens for every CLI tool
- Document hotkeys and thread behavior
- Use threading only when needed â†’ simple is better
